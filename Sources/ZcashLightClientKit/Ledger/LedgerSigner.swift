import Foundation

/// Runs the PCZT signing ceremony against a paired Ledger device over a transport.
///
/// The async counterpart of `pczt_ledger`'s blocking ceremony runner, with the same rules: the session
/// decides every command, its deadline and its retry budget; a `0x6901` refusal is answered by
/// resending the same command after the engine's backoff; an exchange that fails on the transport
/// closes the transport, since the device's reply to the outstanding command can no longer be
/// attributed; every other failure ends the ceremony with the session's error.
///
/// The ceremony holds the transport from before its first command until it is over, so no other
/// ceremony the SDK runs over the same transport (a `LedgerDevice` call, an app switch, another
/// signing) can put a command of its own between two of this one's; one started meanwhile waits. See
/// `LedgerCeremony`.
///
/// Once the ceremony's first command has reached the device, a cancelled task closes the transport, at
/// any point: during an exchange, between two exchanges, or while the session is built. The device can
/// be in the middle of the ceremony, so the caller must open a new connection before it tries again. A
/// task cancelled before that, while it waits for its turn on the transport, closes nothing.
