/// The pairing and address commands of a Ledger device running the Zcash app, over its ``transport``.
///
/// Signing is done by `Synchronizer.signPCZTWithLedger(pczt:accountUUID:binding:transport:progress:)`,
/// which needs the wallet database.
///
/// Every method throws a ``ZcashError`` from the `ledger` family, or `CancellationError` when its task
/// is cancelled. A method whose exchange fails on the transport, or is cancelled once it has started,
/// closes the transport: open a new connection before trying again. A call cancelled while only
/// queued, waiting for another ceremony already in progress, throws `CancellationError` without
/// closing anything: it never reached the transport.
///
/// A `LedgerDevice` runs one call at a time; a second call made while one is in progress waits for
/// it. The call holding the device also holds its transport for all of its commands, and so does
/// every other ceremony the SDK runs over a transport (another `LedgerDevice` over the same
/// transport, a signing ceremony, an app switch): a call made while any of them is in progress waits
/// for it, so no two of them interleave their commands on the device. A call that reconnects
/// mid-flight -- see `pairAccount`'s `reconnect` parameter -- holds its replacement transport the
/// same way for the rest of the call. See `LedgerCeremony`.
///
/// The caller owns every transport: the one passed to `init` and every one a `pairAccount`
/// `reconnect` function returns. This closes a transport whose exchange failed (closing is idempotent)
/// but never closes one otherwise, so the caller closes each transport it opened, whether the call
/// succeeded or failed — unlike `LedgerZcashApp.ensureZcashAppOpen(transport:reconnect:)`, which closes
/// a replacement transport itself when the call fails, `pairAccount` closes a transport its `reconnect`
/// produced only when an exchange on it fails. A failure after the reads answered (the version check,
/// the viewing key parse, the identity check) leaves it open on ``transport``, and the caller closes it
/// then, as it would its own. ``transport`` is the one this device currently
/// talks over; once `pairAccount` has reconnected, it is the reconnected one, and later calls use it.
///
/// Nothing here changes `transport` in response to `ensureZcashAppOpen`: that call may close the
/// transport it is given and return another, so call it before constructing a device, or build a new
/// device over the transport it returns rather than keep using one built over the original.
