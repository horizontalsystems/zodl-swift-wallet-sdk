//! The SDK's extension tables in the wallet database.
//!
//! Tables this SDK stores alongside `zcash_client_sqlite`'s own schema follow the wallet
//! database's extension contract (see `WalletMigrator::with_external_migrations`): every
//! name carries the `ext_zcashlc_` prefix (the wallet promises never to use `ext_`), and
//! the schema is created and evolved exclusively by the [`schemerz`] migrations registered
//! here — never ad hoc at call time — so extension tables share the wallet database's
//! schema versioning. Runtime access goes through
//! [`WalletDb::transactionally_with_extension`], whose authorizer confines writes to the
//! `ext_` namespace and refuses schema changes outright.
//!
//! [`zcashlc_init_data_database`](crate::zcashlc_init_data_database) applies these
//! migrations alongside the wallet's own; every other entry point may assume the tables
//! exist, because the platform initializes the database before using it (the Swift
//! `Initializer` does this at startup).
