//! Per-round voting session: executor, delegation pipeline, clients and
//! cancellation control, opened once per round and held for its lifetime.
//!
//! Everything a round needs that outlives one call lives here, because
//! `zcash_voting` binds it that way: the executor freezes the wallet scope and
//! the proposal roster at construction, the delegation pipeline freezes the
//! account and the lightwalletd anchor, and the chain client freezes the
//! endpoint fleet. Rebuilding them per call would re-validate all of that on
//! every screen tap and could not carry a cancellation signal across calls.
//!
//! [`VotingSession::open`] performs no network I/O. The PIR fleet only records
//! its endpoints, the chain client only validates its configuration, and the
//! helper client only holds a transport; nothing dials until a step runs. That
//! is what lets Swift open a session on the main thread and discover a bad
//! round configuration immediately rather than through a timeout.
//!
//! Every service a session touches rides the route chosen at open — Tor or
//! direct, never falling back: chain and helper traffic, PIR queries and
//! vote-tree sync alike. A PIR query hides which rows are fetched, not who
//! fetches them, so a fleet reached any other way would show the PIR server
//! the device address, the round and one fetch burst per bundle, and the tree
//! node as much again — an address tied to participation and to approximate
//! weight, which is exactly what the route exists to withhold.
//!
//! A run — [`VotingSession::run`] or [`VotingSession::track_shares`] — is
//! driven on the shared runtime instead of on the calling thread, and streams
//! what it observes to the host through an [`EventSink`] as it goes. Neither
//! driver fails: both return a report whose quiescence says why the round
//! stopped, so the errors these methods return are the ones around the run —
//! a signer this host cannot build, a report the wire projection refuses, or a
//! driver task that did not finish.
//!
//! Proving one bundle ahead of a run is the exception to that shape: it runs
//! on a thread this module creates and sizes rather than on the runtime,
//! because Orchard proving needs a stack neither a runtime worker nor the
//! host's calling thread is guaranteed to have.

/// a `vote_end` that never bounded one window. The crate reads that pair for
