//! Software delegation signing and the Keystone signature the device sends back.
//!
//! Two ways to reach the same 64-byte RedPallas SpendAuth signature the crate
//! needs for one delegation bundle. A software wallet derives it here from its
//! own seed; a Keystone wallet's device produced it, and [`keystone_signature`]
//! is where it is lifted out of the PCZT the device signed — after which
//! [`verified_signature_input`] checks that it signs what this wallet asked
//! for, whichever of the two produced it.
//!
//! The crate stopped deriving account keys on the caller's behalf in 2.0 and
//! documents the replacement on `delegate::DelegationSigningRequest`: a
//! software wallet uses `account_index`, `network`, `sighash` and `alpha` to
//! derive its account SpendAuth key locally, randomize it, sign `sighash`, and
//! hand back the signature. So the seed never crosses into `zcash_voting`.
//!
//! # Key material
//!
//! [`SeedSpendAuthSigner`] is the only thing in the voting FFI that holds root
//! seed material, and it holds it for one round-driver run: the session builds
//! it when the run starts, hands the crate an `Arc<dyn SpendAuthSigner>` over
//! it, and drops it when the run ends, at which point [`Zeroizing`] wipes the
//! bytes. Nothing is logged, nothing is persisted, and nothing but the 64-byte
//! signature leaves the signer — not the sighash, not the alpha, not the
//! derived keys. It deliberately has no `Debug`: there is no redacted rendering
//! of a seed worth the risk that someone prints one.
